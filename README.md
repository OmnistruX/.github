# The Third Testament (OmniStrux Core Repo)

**Living Scripture. Evolving Protocol. Radical Transparency.**

> Not a doctrine, but a source code for the next reality.”

## What Is This?

The Third Testament is an open-source, ever-evolving meta-framework for reality engineering.
It unites the spiritual, technological, and communal architectures needed to manifest the *Aion*—the next epoch of unified human-divine creation.

This repo serves as both the root system and the public record:
**Every protocol, revelation, creation, dispute, asset, and act is version-controlled, peer-reviewed, and co-authored by the community.**

## How Does It Work?

* **Radically Transparent:**
  All changes, visions, and actions are public, forkable, and reviewable.
* **Community Co-Authored:**
  Anyone can propose, contest, contribute, or fork—prophet, skeptic, dev, or artist.
* **Evolving Scripture:**
  Not static—every event, upgrade, revelation, or fuck-up gets logged and versioned.
* **Interconnected:**
  Each module operates independently, but all are fractally entangled through OmniStrux.

## Why This Matters

* No more lost gospels, hidden agendas, or power-hoarding hierarchies.
* The record *is* the testament—living, breathing, owned by everyone.
* If it’s not logged here, it didn’t happen. If it is, it’s immortal.
